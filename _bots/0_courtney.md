### Verified Discord bot!

*Courtney* is a little Discord bot that lets you keep track of your character's healthbars. For example, for when you play D&D or any other RPG systems with your friends!

*Courtney* lets you keep a backlog of characters whose HP levels you can modify on the fly and check at any time. She also allows you to visualize these with neat little text-based healthbars.
