### Made for [Ludum Dare 47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47) in around 48 hours!

**<span style="color: rgb(118, 161, 255);">Blue</span>** is you. If you touch **<span style="color: rgb(255, 118, 118);">Red</span>**, you lose. You can only spin in preset levels, jump between levels, and change the way you spin.

Each movement you take spends energy. (**Green** gives you more energy! But use it wisely.)

How long can you stay in the game for?
