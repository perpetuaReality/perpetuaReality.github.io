### Originally made for the [Extra Credits Game Jam 6](https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-6)! *(Did not finish)*

Control your snake and weave your way in and around a little town while you deliver the mail to the people in these times of need.

Time only passes when you move, so think ahead!
