### Made for [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48) in around 70 hours!

The objective is very simple! Just bore as much as you can, as deep as you can! Oh, yeah, I mean “bore” as in “dig”. My bad.

Outrun the screen and the **DEATHWALL**{:.red} at the top of it by digging as far down as you can!
