### Made for [Ludum Dare 47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47) in around 48 hours!

**Blue**{:.blue} is you. If you touch **Red**{:.red}, you lose. You can only spin in preset levels, jump between levels, and change the way you spin.

Each movement you take spends energy. (**Green** gives you more energy! But use it wisely.)

How long can you stay in the game for?
